## Algorithmic Problem Description
Given a set of points in the $\mathbb{R}^2$ plane and a set of disks with distinct radii, we must determine for each disk whether it can move arbitrarily far away from all points without ever touching any of them.

## Solution Approach
We solve this problem using a Delaunay Triangulation. First, we create the triangulation for the network of infected people. For each area in the triangulation, we record the maximum radius $d$ of a disk that could still "escape" given that it fits in the current face. We assign a value of $\infty$ to the infinite faces around the triangulation. We then use a BFS approach to record the maximum possible distance for all neighboring faces, which corresponds to the length of the edge separating the two faces. 

For each infected person, we then need to check only two conditions:
1. Does the starting position intersect with any infected people?
2. Is it possible to escape the current face given the radius of the disk?

The text is now more precise and follows proper technical writing conventions. I maintained all mathematical notation and key concepts while improving readability and clarity.
