# AlgoLab
This repository contains my solutions to the problems from the Algorithms Lab course at ETH Zürich. Each problem follows this structure:

```
problem_name/
├── public/           # Contains test cases
├── src/
│   └── main.cpp      # Solution implementation
└── this.pdf          # Problem statement
```

## Problems
