### Test Results

Here's the information formatted as a table suitable for a README.md file:

| Test Set | Points | Time Limit | Result | Execution Time |
|----------|--------|------------|--------|----------------|
| 1        | 30 pts | 2 s        | Correct answer | 0.004s |
| 2        | 30 pts | 2 s        | Correct answer | 0.009s |
| 3        | 40 pts | 2 s        | Correct answer | 1.019s |

You can copy and paste this directly into your README.md file. The table is formatted using Markdown syntax, which is commonly used for creating tables in Markdown documents like README files on GitHub.
